## About
**Unity Survival Shooter Machine Learning Agent** is an implementation of reinforcement learning in an old basic Unity tutorial project for beginners.

The basic project was downloaded from [here](https://unitylist.com/p/gbc/Unity3D-Survival-Shooter). The game is a top-down shooter in a cute environment. The player needs to shoot different kind of enemies to insure its protection.

The **Unity ML Agent** takes possession of the player and controls it.
